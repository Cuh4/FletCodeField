## ‚ö†Ô∏è | Limitations
- Only works for Windows (tested), Linux (untested), MacOS (untested). Mobile devices will not work with this.
- Pressing Tab will automatically focus a focus-able control. I can't prevent this due to Flet limitations.
- The default shift key mapping is for the UK layout. You can provide a custom mapping by passing it to one of the parameters.
- You cannot select the code.
- There is no text cursor, making it difficult to find out where you're typing.

## ü§î | Example
